# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is now in a stable state with all major build issues resolved. The app successfully
builds and runs on Windows with proper SQLite integration and custom iconography.

## Next Steps

- Implement multi-category support for projects, including data migration.
- Add a "scan folder" feature to automatically detect and import projects.
- Continue with general feature development and testing.
- Refine UI/UX based on user feedback.
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
- Consider adding support for additional platforms (macOS, Linux).

## Learnings

- The project is a Flutter desktop application for Windows.
- It uses SQLite for local data storage via `sqflite_common_ffi`.
- The architecture separates UI, logic, and data concerns.
- SVG icons were successfully migrated to PNG format to resolve rendering issues.
- A custom app icon has been created and applied using `flutter_launcher_icons`.
- The build process works reliably without hardcoded paths.
- SVG files are preserved alongside PNG versions for flexibility.
