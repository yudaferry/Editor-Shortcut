# Active Context

## Current Focus

The project is now in a stable state with all major build issues resolved. The app successfully
builds and runs on Windows with proper SQLite integration and custom iconography. Recent updates
include removing only the close and maximize buttons from the window title bar while keeping the
title bar itself visible for the user.

## Recent Changes

- Removed OS window buttons (close, maximize) by setting `windowButtonVisibility: false`
- Kept the window title bar visible by not enabling `titleBarStyle: TitleBarStyle.hidden`
- Removed the close button from the AppBar since window management is handled by the window title
  bar
- Removed the maximize/fullscreen button from the AppBar to simplify the interface
- Window configuration provides a clean experience with title bar but without intrusive window
  buttons

## Next Steps

- Implement multi-category support for projects, including data migration.
- Add a "scan folder" feature to automatically detect and import projects.
- Continue with general feature development and testing.
- Refine UI/UX based on user feedback.
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
- Consider adding support for additional platforms (macOS, Linux).

## Learnings

- The project is a Flutter desktop application for Windows.
- It uses SQLite for local data storage via `sqflite_common_ffi`.
- The architecture separates UI, logic, and data concerns.
- SVG icons were successfully migrated to PNG format to resolve rendering issues.
- A custom app icon has been created and applied using `flutter_launcher_icons`.
- The build process works reliably without hardcoded paths.
- SVG files are preserved alongside PNG versions for flexibility.
- Window configuration supports hiding window buttons while keeping the title bar for better user
  experience.
