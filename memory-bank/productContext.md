# Product Context

## Problem

Developers often work on multiple projects and use different editors for each. The standard process
involves opening the editor first, then navigating to the project directory. This can be cumbersome
and time-consuming, especially when switching between projects frequently.

## Solution

This application provides a centralized place to list all projects. Users can simply select a
project from the list and choose which installed editor to open it with. This reverses the workflow
to be project-centric rather than editor-centric.

## User Experience Goals

- A simple, intuitive interface for adding, viewing, and managing projects.
- Quick access to open any project in a supported editor.
- A streamlined workflow that saves the user time.
