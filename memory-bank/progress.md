# Progress

## What Works

- The basic project structure is in place.
- The application has screens for managing projects and editors.
- A database service is set up to handle data persistence.
- The application can be launched on Windows.
- The application now has a custom icon.
- The rendering issue with SVG icons has been resolved by migrating to PNGs.

## What's Left to Build

- **Multi-category projects**: Allow projects to have multiple categories and filter by them. This
  will require a data migration strategy.
- **Scan folder for projects**: Implement a feature to scan a directory and automatically add
  discovered projects.
- Detailed implementation of remaining features.
- Thorough testing, including unit, widget, and integration tests.
- UI/UX refinement.
- Error handling and logging improvements.
- Potential support for other platforms (macOS, Linux).
- Icon conversion process has been automated using flutter_launcher_icons package.

## Known Issues

- None currently identified. The app builds and runs successfully on Windows.
